# Neurolib

Presenting Neurolib, my journey into neuroinformatics and the world of neural networks, with building my own python library.

I don't have any experience in neuroinformatics. Just having fun and taking big interest and curiousity with me.

I hope you will enjoy it too and join this process :)

If you have experinces in neuroinformatics and neural networks, fell free to point on issues and optimizations. I'm glad to get some tips and learn through my mistakes.

To-Do:
- Training better (Network overfitted on the MNIST dataset and is very bad at predicting self-written numbers)
